# TR-QNet
A novel integrated framework is referred to as Tensor Ring optimized Quantum-enhanced tensor neural Networks (TR-QNet) is developed relying on a multi-layer design of a Tensor Ring optimized variational Quantum learning classifier (Quan-TR) comprising cascading entangling gates replaces the fully connected (dense) layers of a Tensor Network.
